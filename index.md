I am a PhD student in the [GW Lab](https://gwlab.org/) at the [University of Massachusetts Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/) in the [Department of Biological Sciences]([https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/](https://www.uml.edu/Sciences/biology/)). My [research](/research/) focuses on the molecular mechanisms of climate change stressor-induced carryover effects in eastern oysters.

I am currently a [NRT SWIMMER Fellow](https://www.uml.edu/swimmer/) and received funding from SWIMMER in 2024.

I completed my B.S. in 2022 in the [Brisson lab](https://www.brissonlab.org/) at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/).
