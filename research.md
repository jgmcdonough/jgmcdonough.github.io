### Molecular mechanisms of climate change stressor-induced carryover effects in eastern oysters
My research is part of a collaborative of labs aiming to understand carryover effects in eastern oysters *Crassostrea virginica*. Through mesocosm experiments, we exposed juvenile oysters to two rounds of treatments with manipulated water (dissolved oxygen and warming) in a fully factorial design.

I specifically focus on the molecular mechanisms behind carryover effects through epigenetics (specifically DNA methylation) and transcriptomics.

My first project demonstrated a prior exposure to hypoxia (<2 mg/L) influences DNA methylation in juvenile oysters. We used MethylRAD-seq to identify DNA methylation. The analysis can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis) and as a [preprint](/pdf/mcdonough2025_preprint.pdf).

I am currently investigating changes in gene expression via RNA-seq in response to multiple stressors across two timepoints. The analysis can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq).
